Does the oracle return a 10 decimals Price or 15 decimals Price ?


[09/02/2023 00:02] tom2o17
18 decimal price 
a price of 1$ is represented as 1e18

Why has the protocol team opted out from using traditional oracles and instead implement their own? Out of curiousity


[09/02/2023 06:47] 0xstalin
Has anybody else had issues when installing the packages running yarn install?
I'm having this weird error 😦

[09/02/2023 07:17] bean.eth2
```We are aware that if a range is updated the prevRangeClosePrice for subsequent set ranges will be stale.``` does that mean; when the histroy of the preRangeClosePrice at X is updated/overrided; the X+1 and following prevRangeClosePrice would then be inconsistent, and this is acceptable?


[09/02/2023 07:30] 0xstalin

make sure you're cd'd in the correct folder


[09/02/2023 11:28] plamkata
So since USDY's price is set pretty much manually, there is no possibility for a depeg, since it defines it's own price to the dollar based on APY ?


[09/02/2023 11:34] 0xhelium
Thanks . will the shares mapping return the exact share without decimals or it's also in 18 decimals ?

I'm really confused about how this oracle works. At what interval does the setter need to set the the range?


[09/02/2023 12:45] plamkata
It's really just trust-based. The admin is expected to update the interest rate each time the previous interval ends. If he does not, the latest price would be returned, which could be stale, but from my understanding of the protocol that is not possible

Hey guys, the figure provided in README is a linear graph. Does the mean USDY does not acquire interest in a compounded fashion?


[09/02/2023 13:13] deth2814
same


[09/02/2023 13:29] benrai
What assets is the bridge supposed to be used for? For USDY or rUSDY? Also why should it be necessary to bridge the assets, does anyone know?


[09/02/2023 13:35] plamkata
Any RWA tokens, like USDY and rUSDY and it would be if you want to send some of your tokens to other chains to use them there, for e.g you want to use the lower gas fees on Polygon so you bridge your assets there

You can also potentially bypass node by just running (if node is being a pain)

forge test --fork-url $(grep -w MAINNET_RPC_URL .env | cut -d '=' -f2) --fork-block-number $(grep -w FORK_FROM_BLOCK_NUMBER_MAINNET .env | cut -d '=' -f2) --nmc Test_Prod

Does anyone know what the factory is for? Normaly factories are used to deploy similar contracts, right? But why is there a need to deploy multiple rUSDY contracts on the same chain?


[09/03/2023 12:53] 0xkazimm
how users can get USDY on ondo protocol ? or is it listed on exchanges ? like usdc and usdt ?


[09/03/2023 13:22] 0xkazimm
and when we wrap usdy to get rUSDY, did this rUSDY accrue yield by holding it ?!


[09/03/2023 14:08] jnrlouis
From the docs
> Individuals who hold USDY are able to wrap their USDY tokens and receive an amount of rUSDY tokens proportional to the USD value wrapped. Each rUSDY token is worth 1 dollar, as USDY accrues value (appreciates in price) rUSDY will rebase accordingly.

[09/03/2023 14:16] castle_chain
will the source and destination bridges , and USDY token be deplyed on each chain supproted ? 
in other words , will there be a instance for each contract on each network ??


[09/03/2023 14:31] 0xnirlin
it is rebasing token. So suppose you wrapped 100 usdy and each is worth 1$, so you will get 100rusdy.

But if 1 usdy becomes equal to 1.1usd, yours rusdy supply will increase but 1rusdy will always be 1$

{Reactions}
❤️ (2) 

[09/03/2023 14:31] 0xnirlin
so usdy is not pegged but rusdy is pegged to 1$


[09/03/2023 14:32] anmol.eth
How does the rebasing happens.  I'm actually not sure how the rebasing mechanism works.

Correct you can assume we make all bridges multa - directional


[09/03/2023 15:27] tom2o17
U need to go through the usdy Cash manager which can be thought of as out of scope for this audit 

If you are interested there should be test coverage for this in the repo so u can get a general idea of the flow


[09/03/2023 15:28] tom2o17
Oracle changes price daily look into the balanceOf function on rUSDY contract and that should give u an idea of the rebasing mechanism

you can check videos on stETH. But a simple description is that if the price of usdy in increased, more supply of rUSdY is increased to keep the peg at dollar and of the price decrease for usdY supply for rUSDY is also decrease. It is admin controlled.

allowlist is separate contract, not in scope


[09/03/2023 17:49] castle_chain
but this code in the scope , can you tell me a small info about what does it do ? 
does this check if the sender is allowed , and is the sender is not allowed , it will put him in the allowList ?


[09/03/2023 18:07] tom2o17
You can think about the allowlist as a registry that anyone can add themselves to. It is not in scope for the audit. 

You just have to add yourself to it prior to sending and receiving usdy/rusdy

Why BURNER have ability to burn tokens from any account?


[09/04/2023 05:32] b353n
Nope this is do it by _burnShares function


[09/04/2023 05:32] b353n
not by burn


[09/04/2023 05:32] b353n
I think he talk for this function
```
function burn(address _account, uint256 _amount) external onlyRole(BURNER_ROLE) {
```


[09/04/2023 05:40] anmol.eth
So BURNER can burn anyone's share and get the underlying USDY?


[09/04/2023 05:41] kaveyjoe
No


[09/04/2023 05:48] anmol.eth
So how does this work?  Why BURNER is able to take other's funds?  This may be a silly question but BURNER is a trusted role as mentioned. So just want to get clarity on under what circumstances the burner will call this burn function and take the  user funds? Please clarify what I'm missing in this.


[09/04/2023 05:48] b353n
Yes owner can burn and get USDY of any user


[09/04/2023 05:48] b353n
```
function burn(address _account, uint256 _amount) external onlyRole(BURNER_ROLE) {
        uint256 sharesAmount = getSharesByRUSDY(_amount);

        _burnShares(_account, sharesAmount);

        usdy.transfer(msg.sender, sharesAmount / BPS_DENOMINATOR);

        emit TokensBurnt(_account, _amount);
    }
```


[09/04/2023 05:49] anmol.eth
is this is desired?


[09/04/2023 05:49] b353n
owner is trusted , so i think yes


[09/04/2023 05:49] anmol.eth
Doesn't make sense why this is necessary.


[09/04/2023 05:50] b353n
i think this is design of protocol .. its strange but as i read the owner aka BURNER_ROLE is trusted


[09/04/2023 05:51] b353n
because 
```
_grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, guardian);
        _grantRole(USDY_MANAGER_ROLE, guardian);
        _grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, guardian);
        _grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, guardian);
        _grantRole(BURNER_ROLE, guardian);
        _grantRole(LIST_CONFIGURER_ROLE, guardian);
```


[09/04/2023 05:51] anmol.eth
Yeah right cannot do anything if role is trusted 🤦


[09/04/2023 05:53] b353n
but is strange design i'm agree


[09/04/2023 05:55] anmol.eth
Yeah i'm still not sure why this is needed


[09/04/2023 05:55] b353n
i think its withdraw because if is not withdraw and admin burn somebody rUSDY , him USDY will be stuck in contract forever


[09/04/2023 05:56] b353n
again its strange because owner also have ability to burn USDY from any account and he can burn it from there but its protocol design i really don't know what is idea behind that


[09/04/2023 05:58] anmol.eth
Absolutely. maybe @tom2o17 🌊 can throw some insights on this.

The BURNER role is a special role that allows the holder to burn tokens from any account. This is useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

-Removing tokens from circulation to reduce inflation.
-Destroying tokens that have been compromised or stolen.
-Implementing a burn mechanism as part of a tokenomics plan.
The BURNER role is only available to trusted parties, such as the project developers or a community-elected body. This helps to ensure that the ability to burn tokens is not abused.


[09/04/2023 06:22] anmol.eth
Got it. My  only concern is why the USDY token is transferred to msg.sender instead of account from which the rUSDY shares were burned.

What exactly is rpow doing in dynamic oracle


[09/04/2023 12:06] 0xnirlin
```
 roundUpTo8(
        _rmul(
          _rpow(currentRange.dailyInterestRate, elapsedDays + 1, ONE),

Actually this snippet overall not making enough sense


[09/04/2023 12:27] 0xsl1

This is an admin burn function it exists to seize rUSDY if the user is not legally allowed to own it. Ideally on a happy path this role will never be needed


[09/04/2023 14:27] tom2o17
This function is to be used in cases in which a user has USDY but is legally not allowed to own it you can think about it similar to the blacklist function on USDC


[09/04/2023 14:28] tom2o17
It is the formula with which the price of USDY is calculated.


[09/04/2023 14:29] tom2o17

You can also view the source code for these contracts by going to etherscan and replacing the .io portion of the url with .deth.net


[09/04/2023 15:10] tom2o17
Should bring up a code view of the code deployed @ that address


[09/04/2023 15:12] tom2o17
Also because a fair amount of people have asked about the round function. The 8 here in the rounding function actually refers to the non evm representation of the number so if we are rounding 1 to the 8th decimal place and 1 is represented as 1e18 -> 18-8 = 10


[09/04/2023 17:35] saint6704
should be .deth.net

who is an approver @tom2o17 🌊


[09/05/2023 09:26] benrai
It checkes how high the amount is that should be minted. Different amounts have different number of approvals they need to be executed. E.g. if you send < 100 tokens you need 1 approval and if you send >= 100 tokens you need 2 aprovals. the function `_attachThreshold` just checks how many approvals the transaction needs based on the amount to be minted and `attaches` this number to the `txnToThresholdSet` mapping

does making a transfer alter the value of the coin?
if multiple transfers happen in the same time, can this alter the value or affect the currency by any means ?


[09/05/2023 11:06] tom2o17
You can assume that ondo is the approver


[09/05/2023 12:35] j4x_98
So would any vulnerability related to a malicious approver also fall out of the scope due to the mentioned "Malicous Admin/Operator"?


[09/05/2023 13:31] tom2o17
It depends on the vulnerability, we will take all criteria into consideration. 
I strongly encourage you to document it even if it could potentially be out of scope.
That comment is just there to avoid, POC's like Owner can set range/threshold incorrectly. 
(Because yes admin can do that, but they can also upgrade the proxy as well and brick the protocol)
We generally want you to assume that all whitelisted operators have knowledge of the protocol and wont just be calling setter function with dumb values.

did `simulateRange` function used to know usdy price in specific range (simulate a specefic time )?!


[09/05/2023 14:36] tom2o17
So we added that function to fuzz the range we are about to set prior to setting it.
It will be called in an off chain context so we are not super interested in gas optimizations.
Basically exists to ensure the values we are about to set result in prices that are consistent w/ our backend

Are rUSDY tokens just rebase USDY, and do they not earn any additional interest by being converted to rUSDY?
What is the purpose(usage) of rUSDY?


[09/06/2023 12:31] sobieski_adam
No additional interest as far as I can tell. The sole purpose is to have a stable token which is always worth 1$, while USDY price is varying (ascending in time)

[09/07/2023 06:12] superman_i4g
Yes, you can assume that


[09/07/2023 08:49] mrosas
Why not use chainlink oracle?


[09/07/2023 09:43] zigtur
This oracle is custom as it calculates price depending on elapsedDays and an interest rate per day


[09/07/2023 11:03] sobieski_adam
Because there is no need. Chainlink Oracle may be used to obtain the price from the outside markets, while the price of USDY does not depend on external supply/demand but is calculated based on constant formula. The only variable in this formula is the daily interest rate determined by the yield of the bank deposits which the USDY represents. As this variable is not expected to be very volatille, it is enough to set it once per month - and this is exactly what the custom oracle does.

changes the unit of account ^

Ohhh nice, so `rUSDY` can be gotten in other ways like from exchanges or minted from admin, but if you want `rUSDY` that earns yield , you have to wrap usdy, cause I mean there has to be ones that earn yield and ones that dont for it to all make sense

`4 * 5` --is the same as--> `4 x 5`


[09/07/2023 20:19] tofunmi
Should be * not +, yeah

[09/07/2023 20:20] tofunmi
Changing it to * still gives a parabolic function though

you did this one?


[09/07/2023 21:55] sovaslava9
yes


[09/07/2023 22:05] 0xstalin
yeah, about reentrancy and nonces collision, but those look invalid IMHO, I think I didn't see them because they are not an issue, but I do really want to see the result of those reports, I have already copy the issues number and wrote down some comments


[09/07/2023 22:06] 0xnirlin
btw, what if there are multiple issues within one function each requiring their own fix, but some intelligent dude submit all of them as one, how even duplication works in this case/


[09/07/2023 22:10] 0xnevi
Nope 😢


[09/07/2023 22:11] 0xstalin
If the report containing all the issues is valid, the rest of the reports that reports only a portion of all the issues will be marked as partial-X, (partial-50) (partial-75)(partial-25)


[09/07/2023 22:13] 0xnirlin
report is valid, but the thing is issues are different. One in modifier and one in internal function.


[09/07/2023 22:14] 0xstalin
yeah, that's what I mean, if one report is reporting the two issues, the other report that is reporting only one will get a partial finding


[09/07/2023 22:15] 0xnirlin
lol, I am literally raged. Fault of the reporter who thought to submit two separate issues as one report. Why punish others, maybe instead mark the same as dup of two.


[09/07/2023 22:17] 0xstalin
I don;t exactly know how the partial findings are rewarded, but I believe a portion of the reward goes the warden who reported the partial report, and the other portion goes to the wared who reported the full report


[09/07/2023 22:17] 0xnirlin
I reported both as two separate issues 🙂


[09/07/2023 22:18] 0xnirlin
No point in discussing if both get invalidated 😂  😂
